# 🦅 Sky IT Solutions Website 🦅
Sky IT Solutions: A Modern, Responsive, and Dynamic Website.

##  💻 Implementation. 💻
The website is built using React as the framework, powered by Vite for frontend development.

## 🔑 Key points. 🔑
⭐ Static client-based website tailored for an IT company.<br />
⭐ Component-based architecture for seamless scalability.<br />
⭐ Utilizes a local database for dynamic data updates without altering components.<br />
⭐ Optimized SVGs for faster page rendering.<br />

## 🗒️ Project. 🗒️
Recognizing the outdated appearance of Sky IT Solutions’ existing website, I took the initiative to design a modern replacement. As a part-time employee, I worked on this project during my personal time. Despite initial reluctance from the owner, it will soon become the company’s official website.

## New website:
<div class="flex">
<img src="/WebsiteSamples/NewWebsite/new-page.jpeg" width="300" />
</div>

## Old website:
<div class="flex flex-col">
<img src="/WebsiteSamples/OldWebsite/oldweb-company.png" width="300" />
<img src="/WebsiteSamples/OldWebsite/old-website-skyit.JPG" width="300" />
<img src="/WebsiteSamples/OldWebsite/oldweb-contactus.png" width="300" />
</div>
